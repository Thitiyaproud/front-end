Face, Glasses, and Hat Detection Front-End
This is a front-end application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to interact with a Flask backend that performs face, glasses, and hat detection. The backend repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Thitiyaproud/senior-project-back-end.git).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
